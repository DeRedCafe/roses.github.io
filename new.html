          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration for you.
          Even though we're far apart, your presence is always with me, like a gentle whisper in my heart. Even without seeing you, I feel your warmth and love every day.
          I may not know the exact details of your appearance, but in my mind, you're a beautiful mystery, and your essence is what I'm drawn to the most.
          Distance can't dim the strength of my feelings for you. They reach across the miles and wrap around you, holding you close in my thoughts and heart.
          Today, as we celebrate love, I'm reminded of how much you mean to me. Here's to us, and to the day when we can finally be together. Happy Rose Day, my dear Red.
